## Introduction
Breadth-First Search is a traversal technique that explores neighbors before moving to the next level neighbors. It's particularly useful for finding the shortest path on unweighted graphs.

## Objective
This project is a web-based simulation of the Breadth-First Search algorithm, designed as part of the internal assessment for our Engineering Semester 4. It aims to demonstrate how BFS explores vertices and edges in a graph, providing a visual and interactive way to understand the algorithm's dynamics.

## Prerequisites
- Basic knowledge of web development.
- Understanding of the BFS algorithm.
- VSCode or any IDE

## Installation

### Step 1: Setting Up the Environment
- Install Visual Studio Code or any preferred IDE that supports web development.
- Ensure you have a stable internet connection for downloading necessary extensions.

### Step 2: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/shriya02-coder/BFS-Simulation.git
cd BFS-Simulation
```

### Step 3: Install Extensions
For VSCode:
- Open the Extensions panel (Ctrl+Shift+X).
- Search for and install extensions related to HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Live Server.

## Running the Simulation

### Step 1: Open the Project
- Open the folder containing the simulation files in your IDE.
- Locate the `index.html`, `script.js`, and `style.css` files.

### Step 2: Start the Live Server
- Right-click on `index.html` and select 'Open with Live Server'.
- Your default web browser will launch, displaying the simulation.

## Interacting with the Simulation
- The simulation provides a graphical representation of a graph.
- Use the provided controls to initiate the BFS algorithm.
- Observe how BFS traverses the graph, highlighting nodes and paths.


## Features
- Interactive graph representation.
- Step-by-step traversal highlighting.
- Control panel for user interaction.

## Troubleshooting
- Ensure all extensions and dependencies are correctly installed.
- Check the browser console for any errors if the simulation doesn't run.

## Conclusion
This BFS simulation is designed to enhance learning and provide a visual understanding of the algorithm's functionality. It's a valuable tool for students and educators alike in exploring algorithmic concepts.
